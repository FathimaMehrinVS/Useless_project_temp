Project Description

A fun, interactive web application that measures your productivity level through a series of hilarious multiple-choice questions, now enhanced with Firebase integration for real user data and certificate generation!

The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Most productivity surveys are boring and serious, making users dread taking them. Who wants a dull quiz when you can laugh at your own uselessness?

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Introducing UselessIn — the world’s first Uselessness Network, designed to celebrate all the quirky, absurd “skills” that traditional professional networks don’t dare to showcase. Because let’s face it, not everyone needs to be productive — some of us excel at the art of doing nothing, and that deserves recognition!

How UselessIn works:

Users sign up by entering their name and listing their “skills” — but with a twist: these skills are proudly ridiculous and intentionally useless, such as “Can sleep 14 hours straight” or “Expert in losing TV remotes.”

The app randomly assigns a Uselessness Score between 0 and 100%, where higher means more useless — and that’s a badge of honor!

A leaderboard ranks the top 10 most useless people, showcasing their hilarious “achievements,” like “Successfully microwaved ice cream” or “Sent an email without attachment, twice.”

Users can endorse each other for useless skills — the more endorsements, the higher their uselessness rank. Imagine being celebrated as the “CEO of Doing Nothing” or “Master of Excuses!”

This playful network not only adds humor and fun but also flips the conventional idea of “professionalism” on its head. It encourages lighthearted interaction and lets users revel in their everyday absurdities — making networking genuinely entertaining.
